# Sound Swarm
 
Pure Data program that simulates the synhcronisation of multiple vocalising agents.  Individual agents may be configured at run time to operate in stimulus-response, Kuramoto oscillator or feedback-control mode.  Also, each agent can be configured to vocalise a beep, a human sound, a cicada or a bird.
